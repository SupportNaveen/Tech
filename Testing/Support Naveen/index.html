            <h1>What is Software Testing</h1>
            <br />
            <p>
              Software testing is the process of evaluating software to find
              defects. It helps to ensure that the software meets its
              requirements and works as expected.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Functional testing: We verify that your web application or
                website works as expected and meets the user requirements.
              </li>
              <li>
                Usability testing: We evaluate how easy and intuitive your web
                application or website is to use by real users.
              </li>
              <li>
                Compatibility testing: We check that your web application or
                website works well across different browsers, devices, operating
                systems, and screen resolutions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Performance testing: We measure how fast and responsive your web
                application or website is under different load and stress
                conditions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Security testing: We identify and eliminate any potential
                vulnerabilities or risks that could compromise the
                confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your web
                application or website.

              Software testing is the process of verifying and validating that a
              software product or system meets the specified requirements and
              expectations of the stakeholders. It is an essential part of
              software development and maintenance that ensures the quality,
              reliability, and functionality of the software.
            </p>
            <p>
              Software testing can be performed manually or automatically, using
              various tools and techniques. It can also be done at different
              levels, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing,
              user acceptance testing, etc. Software testing can also cover
              different aspects, such as functionality, usability,
              compatibility, performance, security, etc.
            </p>
