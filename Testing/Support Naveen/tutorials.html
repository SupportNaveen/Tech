            <p>
              Unit testing is the testing of individual units of code. It is the
              most basic level of software testing and is performed by the
              developer of the code. Unit testing ensures that each unit of code
              meets its requirements and works as expected.

            <p>
              Integration testing is the testing of how different units of code
              interact with each other. It is performed after unit testing and
              ensures that the different units of code work together as
              expected. Integration testing can be performed manually or using a
              test automation tool.

            <p>
              System testing is the testing of the entire system to ensure that
              it meets all of its requirements. It is performed after
              integration testing and ensures that the system works as expected
              from a user's perspective. System testing can be performed
              manually or using a test automation tool.

            <a href="acceptance-testing.html">Acceptance Testing</a>
            <p>
              Acceptance testing is the testing of the system by the customer or
              end user to ensure that it meets their needs. Acceptance testing
              is typically performed manually and can be done in phases, such as
              alpha testing and beta testing.
